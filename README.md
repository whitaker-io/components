`Machine` is a library for creating data workflows. These workflows can be either very concise or quite complex, even allowing for cycles for flows that need retry or self healing mechanisms. 

It supports 
[opentelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go) spans and metrics out of the box 

It also supports building dynamic pipelines using 
- native go plugins 
- [hashicorp](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin)
- [yaegi](https://github.com/traefik/yaegi)
- [tengo](https://github.com/d5/tengo)
